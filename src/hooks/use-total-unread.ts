/**
 * Count of conversations with at least one unread inbound message for
 * the current user. Used by the sidebar to surface a green dot on the
 * Inbox nav entry when the user is elsewhere in the app.
 *
 * Lives on its own realtime channel (distinct from the inbox page's
 * "inbox-realtime") so both can coexist without sharing state.
 *
 * The channel topic is suffixed with a per-instance id because the hook
 * is now mounted more than once at a time — the sidebar and the mobile
 * tab bar both show the badge, and on phones both are mounted together.
 * supabase-js hands back the *existing* channel for a repeated topic, so
 * a fixed name made the second mount call `.on()` on an already
 * subscribed channel, which throws "cannot add postgres_changes
 * callbacks ... after subscribe()" and takes the whole shell down.
